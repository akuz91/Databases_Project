# Issue_Tracking_System

The project was completed for the Principles of Databases (CS-GY-6083) course at NYU in Spring 2020. A web-based issue tracking system was devleoped and integrated with a database management system. The system allows users to create projects, set up workflow schemas, report project issues, assign issues to other users, and update the status of issues based on the project's defined workflow schema. 

The first part of the project focused on developing and implementing a database system, and the second part focused on developing the web application.
